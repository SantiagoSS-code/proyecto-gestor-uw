Notes: All prices are approximate (region: US) and rounded in table. Monthly totals are small for these low volumes. For exact billing use Google Cloud Pricing Calculator.

Assumptions:
- Page size: 200 KB
- Pages per visit: 4
- Visits: Low=300, Med=750, High=1000
- Photos: Low total=130 (30 clubs +100 users), Med total=200 (50+150), High total=250 (50+200) over 3 months
- Photos size: 1 MB each
- Firestore reads/writes as provided (3-month totals divided by 3 for monthly)
- Cloud Run cost is a small estimate for very low CPU/requests use (may increase with heavy workloads)
